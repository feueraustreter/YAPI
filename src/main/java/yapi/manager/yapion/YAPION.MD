# YAPION
**YAPION** (jap*i*on) is a slim and fast Object Notation specialized on Java Objects.
It can handle recursive Object structures and state specific serialization and deserialization (SsS/D).
This SsS/D is achieved by a self build annotation system used by YAPION. This object notation is designed for easy usage with complex Object structures and can do even more complex stuff fairly easy.   

## YAPION's naming
```
Y   -> @yoyosource   
API -> application programming interface
ON  -> object notation
```
