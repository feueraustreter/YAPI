# YAPI
My Java API **YAPI** is a diverse and powerful API to make your live easier with coding. Some problems and ideas have neat solutions within this api. To use it just import it and for questions ask me on GitHub. Feel free to leave suggestions and improvements to any method, class or structure there too. 

## YAPI's naming
Y for YoyoNow or @YoyoSource. API for application programming interface. You could even say library as this is a consortium of methods and data structures.

### Version 1.0
Version 1.0 is the initial release of the [YAPI](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI). This Version focuses on Math, Encryption and Password cracking through brute-force. As the [YAPI](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI) is just a Hobby project the releases won't be regular and what gets released will be heavily influenced by my mood.
I will although try to remove any [Issue](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/issues) and [Bug](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/issues) as soon as possible. [Enhancements](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/issues) are encouraged but will be worked off `.dequeue()` after [Bugs](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/issues) or [Issues](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/issues). As I am alone I prefer that you can help me with a [pull request](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/pulls) on GitHub. I will look into any and try to implement your idea or pull request with the existing system if it is useful and possible.
The [Wiki](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/wiki) will be done soon. If you want to help me fell free to do so with ideas on how to create the Wiki. 
### Version 1.1-alpha
Version 1.1-alpha is a pre-release of the [YAPI](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI) and is unfinished. There shouldn't be any problems with this version and everything should work alright. The focus of this version was on some String-Utilities, an efficient Object-Notation (YAPION) and a Compression algorithm for this Object-Notation. 
I also want to thank everyone, who participated in helping me with this project. Without every tester I had the YAPI got a bit better and I am pleased with this. I hope you all will help even more. To give me an Idea or Bug-Report just make a [pull request](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/pulls) or open an [issue](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/issues) on GitHub
