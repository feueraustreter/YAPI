# YAPI
My Java API **YAPI** is a diversed and powerfull API to make you live easier with coding. Some problems and ideas have neat solutions within this api. To use it just import it and for questions ask me on GitHub. Feel free to leave suggestions and improvements to any method, class or structure. 

## YAPI's naming
Y for YoyoNow or @YoyoSource. API for application programming interface. You could even say library as this is a consortium of methods and data structures.

### Version 1.0
Version 1.0 is the initial release of the [YAPI](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI). This Version focuses on Math, Encryption and Password cracking through bruteforce. As the [YAPI](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI) is just a Hobby project the releases won't be regular and what gets released will be heavily influenced by my mood.
I will although try to remove any [Issue](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/issues) and [Bug](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/issues) as soon as possible. [Enhancements](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/issues) are encouraged but will be worked off `.dequeue()` after [Bugs](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/issues) or [Issues](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/issues). As I am alone I prefer that you can help me with a [pull request](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/pulls) on GitHub. I will look into any and try to implement your idea or pull request with the existing system if it is useful and possible.
The [Wiki](https://github.com/yoyosource/YAPI/wiki) will be done soon. If you want to help me fell free to help me on the Wiki with ideas how to create it and so.
